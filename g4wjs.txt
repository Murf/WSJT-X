K1JT: I am very sorry to convey the sad news that Bill Somerville,
G4WJS, died suddenly and unexpectedly a few days ago.  He was only
about 65 years old.

Bill was a dear friend and very close colleague, though (as is often
the case with worldwide ham radio friendships) we had met in person
only a few times.  In 2013 he was the first to join me in forming a
core development group for WSJT-X, which at that time was at program
version 0.99.  Bill has been closely involved with WSJT-X and related
software projects ever since.

Our free, open-source software could not have achieved its extensive
worldwide popularity and influence in ham radio without Bill's
essential contributions.  In addition to writing code for important
portions of the Qt-based user interface for WSJT-X, Bill helped to
bring the overall program structure more nearly up to professional
standards.  Moreover, he devoted countless hours to program support,
patiently answering user's questions on WSJT-related forums.

I have only started to think about the many ways in which I will miss
Bill -- not no mention how we all will miss his immense and positive
impact on WSJT-X and related projects.  For more than eight years Bill
and I communicated closely and regularly on ham radio topics,
sometimes many times per day.  Perhaps I will be able to write more
about it in the near future.

Rest in peace, dear friend G4WJS.

RIP indeed Bill,

 

You have provided an excellent service to the WSJT-X community. I think your last post was a couple of days ago. We will all miss you, and your incisive resolution of all our problems.

 

Requiescat in pace.

The silent key of Bill is very sad news.

Bill has been extremely helpful for radio amateurs to make WSJT-X fit their different radios and computers. We have seen E-mail answers from him coming at all times during borh day and night. And we wonder if he ever got time to sleep or eat, in-between his good answers and advices to radio amateurs world wide.

So rest in peace Bill, and thank you very much for all the help you have provided to radio amateurs world wide, for making their digital radio amateur activity very successful.

I never worked Bill.  Did he even have time to operate?  I never met Bill.  But I would have liked to.  I never sent him an email, either personal or on this group.  I wish I had.

I enjoyed my daily (actually several times a day) reading of the messages posted in this group and his replies.  I learned a lot from them.  This man had so much knowledge and the fact that he took the time to deal with almost every post in this group and share that knowledge, its truly a testament to this man.  I for one will surely miss him.

I wish I knew him better.  Rest in Peace, Bill.

His passing will affect much done within WSJT-X, as well as Hamlib.   He was a font of knowledge and 'corporate' memory.

We may not see his like again.

His contributions will be long remembered, and very much appreciated. So sad to see someone go who gave so much so freely to our community. RIP, Bill.

Very sad to hear. May his memory be a blessing to his family and all who knew him.

In the Law Enforcement, Fire and Emergency Medical Services, the passing on of one such is often marked with a 'Last Call' or 'Final Dispatch' in which the departed's call sign is requested thrice for one last time. Usually at a pre-arranged or significant time. Seems appropriate in this case as well. Perhaps you could do that for us Joe.

Very sad day for amateur radio.

A Tribute to my dearest friend Bill Somerville G4WJS.

I apologize for length of this post. This might answer a few previous posts .Knowing Bill he will be still reading all these posts from a better place.

I thank you for your speedy post Joe.

Bill G4WJS was one of my dearest friends living just 4 miles apart.We spoke 2/3 times a week and at times several times a day.
After a 20 year plus break Bill spurred me on to come back into the radio family.I OWE HIM A LOT.Thanks to him my major interest in the last 10 years has been WSJT-X. Bill also had a passion for Photography and me being a Photographer for The Sun Newspaper In London before I retired had another common interest we liked to have a good natter but I often came off the worst.Bill lived on his own so we kept a close eye on each other.
Bill had a degree in Chemistry but as I understand was self taught in computing and electronics.Please see his QRZ page.
He was a whizz.He was a great natural teacher and Joe I think this was one of the reasons he got on so well with you and the group.He remarked to me many times "I never mind helping anyone provided they help themselves" At times glaring at me  muttering under his breath "Read the notes and the posts" Sometimes it so annoyed him when I could not keep a straight face..we all know the story.Bill always willing to help with a computer grafted to his hand.
Over the last ten years he has like others in the group spent hours and hours involved with WSJX-X.He had a great admiration for open source programs.Made many friends within the digital community and a big respect for Dxlabs {Dave] JTalert [Laurie] among others. I was always giving him praise for taking a break and TXing winding up this 4 ele ,of late not often[Bill head in PC} every day I would have a crafty check on his PSK. Bill was very much in favour of Using L.O.T.W but never collected awards,but on receiving a trophy for technical achievement announced at Dayton when he told me there was no emotion but I knew Bill just to well he was chuffed !

Sadly last Friday after never responding to my calls I found Bill seated in his shack at peace surrounded by the things he loved most.
I am still total shock!!!
Such a loss of a talented and loyal friend and as I have said he shall be greatly missed by many in our radio family.

R.I.P.William [Bill ] G4WJS. God Bless you and till we meet again 73..........................................Cheers mate!

My God!

Whats terrible news is this!

Bill helped me in many occasions with WSJT-X always with a very pure "ham-spirit" and availability.

My very sincere condolence to all his family and friends, I will miss him a lot despite I never had the pleasure to meet him.

That is truly unwelcome and most distressing news, Joe; I'm sure the vast amounts of time 
and effort that Bill devoted to the development and support of WSJT-X will be very sorely 
missed by everyone in the community, whether or not they had ever had any direct dealings 
with Bill.  

Please convey all our sympathies and our deepest condolences to Bill's relatives and friends.

73, Martin G0HDB

I am saddened to learn of your news.   This is blow to the WSJT-X community.

In the early days of Bill’s involvement with WSJT he often logged into my Macs at home to test his software modifications on a Mac until he got a VM working.  He and I had numerous discussions while testing new versions on various Mac OS.   He was generous with his time in helping folks with problems either running the codes or attempting to build the software on various platforms.    The multitude of emails to the development list is a tribute to his commitment to ensure that the various programs operated flawlessly.

His involvement with the development of WSJT-X code especially with modernising the structure of the whole program has been immense.   I will certainly miss his advice.

A sad day…

— John G4KLA

Shocking and saddening news, he will be greatly missed.

My condolences to his family and friends, and RIP Bill.

Alan G0TLK, sent from my mobile device

I only knew Bill through his contributions to the WSJT lists. Those contributions were sharp, radical, and usually encouraging. He was a clearly essential part of a team that is helping Amateur Radio to grow, expand and develop, far beyond what you and I knew when, soldering iron in hand, we first played with radio, all those years ago.

My condolences to his family and friends. We shall all miss him.

Robin, G8DQX

We were also shocked and very sorry to hear of Bill's sudden passing. I never had the pleasure of meeting him in person.  Like Bob, he attended the same University and read the same degree.

We are so grateful for his contributions over many years to WSJT-X. His support for users was first class, and he even joined the EME reflectors to give support to EME users during the roll-out of Q65, despite not being active himself on EME.  He was contributing there regularly, and some of his last efforts were to support the use of WSJT-X for Doppler control on CW on the microwave bands.

He was also a very patient and diligent teacher, tutoring and helping  those who wished to make small contributions to the project. I am very grateful for the time he spent in such ways.

Bill will surely be greatly missed, and sincere condolences to his family and many friends.

RIP Bill.

Charlie G3WDG / DL3WDG

I had the pleasure of taking to Bill over Skype a few times during the development of 1.7 and later 1.8 to chase down some CAT control gremlins with several radios I happen to own. His patience and intelligence was incredible. Such a huge loss to us all. 

My sincerest condolences to his family and friends. 

He will definitely be missed but his contributions to the advancement of amateur radio will live on indefinitely.
