Set up the Wide Graph (also called the Waterfall). 
It is important to set appropriate lower and upper 
audio frequency limits for the Wide Graph because these limits define the FT8 decoder's search window:

- Set *Start* = 100 Hz.
- Set *Bins/Pixel* = 5. Smaller/larger values make the Wide Graph cover a smaller/larger 
frequency range.
- Use the mouse to grab the left or right edge of the *Wide Graph*, and
adjust its width so that the upper frequency limit is about 3300 Hz.

The *N Avg* setting controls how many spectra are averaged to produce each line in the spectrogram. 
Smaller values make the spectrogram update more frequently, resulting in signals being more spread
out in the vertical (time) direction.
On the other hand, larger values make it easier to detect very weak signals:

- Set *N Avg* = 2. 

The *Palette* setting controls the color scheme used for the spectrogram: 

- Set *Palette* = Fldigi 

When *Flatten* is checked, WSJT-X attempts to correct for rolloff at the lowest and highest
frequencies in the spectrum: 

- *Flatten* = checked 
- Select *Cumulative* for data display
- Set the *Gain* and *Zero* sliders for the waterfall and spectrum to near midscale

The *Spec* setting determines what fraction of the vertical extent of the Wide Graph will
be used for the line plot of the spectrum. Setting *Spec* to 0 will eliminate the line plot.

- Set *Spec* = 25%
