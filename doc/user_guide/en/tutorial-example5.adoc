Do not confuse FST4 with FT4, which has a very different purpose!
FST4 is designed primarily for making weak-signal 2-way QSOs on the 
LF and MF bands. T/R periods from 15s up to 1800s are 
available. Longer T/R periods provide better sensitivity provided that the
combined effects of Tx and Rx frequency instability and channel Doppler spread
yield a received signal that remains coherent over the duration of 
several transmitted symbols. Generally speaking, Rx and Tx frequency changes 
during the transmission and channel Doppler spread should each be small compared
to the symbol keying rate shown for each T/R duration in Table 7 within section
<<PROTOCOL_OVERVIEW,Protocol Specifications>>. For example, the keying rate for the 1800s T/R period is 0.089 Baud, so
successful operation using this T/R length requires Tx and Rx frequency
stability better than 0.089 Hz over the duration of the 1800s transmission in 
addition to channel Doppler spread smaller than 0.089 Hz. 

Operation with FST4 is similar to that with other _WSJT-X_ modes: most
on-screen controls, auto-sequencing, and other features behave in
familiar ways.  However, operating conventions on the 2200 and 630 m
bands have made some additional user controls desirable.  Spin boxes
labeled *F Low* and *F High* set lower and upper frequency limits used
by the FST4 decoder, and these limits are marked by dark green
angle-bracket symbols *< >* on the Wide Graph frequency scale:

It's best to keep the decoding range fairly small, since QRM and
transmissions in other modes or sequence lengths will slow down the
decoding process (and of course will be undecodable).  By checking 
*Single decode* on the the *File | Settings | General* tab, you can
further limit the decoding range to the setting of *F Tol* on
either side of *Rx Freq*.

.Open a Wave File:

- Select *FST4* on the *Mode* menu. Set *T/R* to 60 s and *Decode | Deep*.
- Set *F Low* 1000, *F High* 1400. 
- Open a sample Wave file using *File | Open* and select the file
...\save\samples\FST4+FST4W\210115_0058.wav. When the file opens you should see something similar to the following screen shots:
