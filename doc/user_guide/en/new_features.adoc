[[NEW_FEATURES]]
=== New in Version {VERSION}

_WSJT-X 2.4.0_ introduces *Q65*, a new digital protocol designed for
minimal two-way QSOs over especially difficult propagation paths.  On
paths with Doppler spread more than a few Hz, the weak-signal
performance of Q65 is the best among all WSJT-X modes.

Q65 uses message formats and sequencing identical to those used in
FST4, FT4, FT8, and MSK144.  Submodes are provided with a wide variety
of tone spacings and T/R sequence lengths 15, 30, 60, 120, and 300 s.
A new, highly reliable list-decoding technique is used for messages
that contain previously copied message fragments.  Message averaging
is provided for situations where single transmissions are too weak or
signal enhancements too sparse for a signal to be decoded.
